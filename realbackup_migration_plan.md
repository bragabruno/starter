- [ ] Ensure plugin dependencies are properly handled

## Phase 4: UI and Experience Customization

- [ ] Configure UI elements to match preferences
- [ ] Set up additional tools from realbackup_nvim
- [ ] Test for compatibility issues

## Phase 5: Refinement

- [x] Resolve conflicts between migrated configs and NvChad
- [x] Clean up redundancies
- [x] Document the custom setup
- [x] Enhance file search with preview functionality

**Status: ✅ Completed**
