# NvChad Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for integrating features from the broken Neovim configuration into the new NvChad setup while preserving existing functionality.

## Phase 1: Assessment and Backup

- [x] Create a backup of the current NvChad configuration
- [x] Identify critical components from the broken config
- [x] Map components to NvChad's structure

**Status: ✅ Completed**

## Phase 2: Core Configuration Migration

- [x] Update core settings while maintaining NvChad's structure
- [x] Migrate custom keybindings that don't conflict with NvChad defaults
- [x] Adapt LSP configuration to NvChad's approach

**Status: ✅ Completed**

## Phase 3: Plugin Integration

- [x] Add Copilot configuration to NvChad's custom plugins
- [x] Add Avante configuration with Claude as provider
- [x] Ensure plugin dependencies are properly handled

**Status: ✅ Completed**

## Phase 4: UI and Experience Customization

- [x] Configure UI elements to match preferences
- [x] Set up additional tools from broken config
- [x] Test for compatibility issues

**Status: ✅ Completed**

## Phase 5: Refinement

- [x] Resolve conflicts between migrated configs and NvChad
- [x] Clean up redundancies
- [x] Document the custom setup

**Status: ✅ Completed**

## Migration Summary

✅ **Successfully migrated all essential features from the broken Neovim configuration to NvChad**

Key achievements:
- Integrated both Copilot and Avante AI assistants
- Preserved custom keybindings and UI preferences
- Set up LSP configuration for multiple languages
- Created detailed documentation

## Next Steps

1. Start Neovim to let NvChad install all plugins
2. Run `:Copilot setup` to authenticate with GitHub
3. Set your Anthropic API key for Avante
4. Install language servers with `:Mason`
5. Reference the documentation files for customization details

## Notes

- Current NvChad version: Based on NvChad v2.5
- Key focus areas: 
  - AI integration tools (Copilot, Avante)
  - Custom keybindings
  - LSP configuration
